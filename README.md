# Surface Laplacian
This function attempts to compute the surface laplacian transform to an mne Epochs object. The algorithm follows the formulations of Perrin et al. (1989) and it consists for the most part in a nearly-literal translation of Mike X Cohen's 'Analyzing neural time series data' corresponding MATLAB code (2014).
